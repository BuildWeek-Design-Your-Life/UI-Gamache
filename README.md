# Build Week - UI Portion of Project

I have created two web pages for our Build Week Project - "Design Your Life." The index.html page is the main marketing page. The about-index.html page is the About the Team page. Each page has its own .less files in the less directory as well as .css files in the css directory. All of the image files are located in the img directory. 

#Project Description

We were tasked with creating an application that helps people figure out what brings them joy. After logging in, you are able to record your activities and rate them on a number scale as to how much enjoyment they bring you. 

After logging the activities, you are able to go back and reflect on the results and plan your future endeavors accordingly. 

# Instructions
Clone a copy of the repo to your local machine.
Create a branch for any changes you want to make. 
Run a compiler when changing any of the less files.
Once you have saved your changes, add, commit and push to your branch.
Submit a pull request in order to merge with master.

The website for the the project is https://build-week-one.netlify.com/. 

# Special Thanks
